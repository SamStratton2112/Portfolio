            <p>
                I am a determined individual with a diverse background and a passion for logical reasoning. Originally aspiring to be a helicopter pilot, my journey took an unexpected turn when I decided to venture into the world of technology after witnessing firsthand the outdated software plaguing the aviation industry.
            </p>
            <p>
                 Motivated by the aspiration to be a part of the evolution of tech, I embarked on Springboardâ€™s software engineering bootcamp. I not only honed my skills in coding but also discovered a new and exciting passion. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The transition from the cockpit to the command line has been an exhilarating ride, and I am eager to continue my journey in the ever-evolving field of tech as a software developer.
